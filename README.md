# BETTER SAM

Let's make it easier for businesses to register with the federal government.

For initial reference, I'll be pulling from my own experience (see the ["Me and Sam"](https://speakerdeck.com/jedwood/me-and-sam) presentation) and the findings from a GSA usability test.

## THREE ANGLES

### 1. Flow, language, and overall UX.
Rethink the order, use more progressive disclosure, ask questions more simply and clearly.

- Clear the room: registering a new business is a long and info-packed ordeal. Remove all the extraneous top nav and sidebars.
- Use human language.
- Show progress and estimates of time to complete each section.
- Progressive disclosure and info gathering- ask "why are you registering?" early, to tailor questions throughout.

### 2. Inline help.
From simple "what's this?" hover tips to full screencast walkthroughs (e.g. getting a DUNS number).

### 3. Layout and interaction at the field level.
Borrowing from the work of Luke W., current best practices, and common sense.

- Required fields: kill the asterisks, remove every optional field possible, and mark the remaining optional ones with "(optional)" in the label.
- Real-time client-side validation of fields that have a decent likelihood of producing errors
- Favor Top-aligned labels for fastest completion time and scan-ability ( http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?504 )

## DELIVERABLE

The first deliverable will be a working prototype that demonstrates several specific examples of the concepts above.
